Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that has more than 80 times the warming power
of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. At
least 30% of today's global warming is driven by methane from human actions.
Cutting methane emissions associated with human activities - including avoidable
emissions from oil and gas operations, agriculture, and waste management - is
the single fastest way to slow the rate of global warming.
