  title: 'NLCD 2021: USGS National Land Cover Database, 2021 release',
  version: '1.0',
  description: |||
    The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal
    agencies, has now developed and released seven National Land Cover
    Database (NLCD) products: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2019,
    and 2021. Beginning with the 2016 release, land cover products were
    created for two-to-three-year intervals between 2001 and the most
    recent year. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable
    information on the Nationâ€™s land cover and land cover change.
    NLCD continues to provide innovative, consistent, and robust
    methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and
    land cover change database.
    
    The NLCD 2021 release is update based, so the Land Cover and Impervious
    Surface products released in [2019](USGS_NLCD_RELEASES_2019_REL_NLCD)
    are unchanged and used directly with NLCD 2021 for change analysis
    though the NLCD timespan. Science products and the change index are
    updated and will need to be reacquired to contain the additional 2021
    change. These new products use a streamlined compositing process for
    assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary
    datasets; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover
    change analysis strategy; a theme-based post-classification protocol for
    generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields
    biophysical parameters modeling method; and a scripted operational system.
    The overall accuracy of the 2019 Level I land cover was 91%. Results from
    this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly
    automated procedure for NLCD 2021 operational mapping
    (see [doi:10.1080/15481603](https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2023.2181143)
    for the latest accuracy assessment publication). Questions about the NLCD
    2021 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2021 land cover
    mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or
    mrlc@usgs.gov. See included spatial metadata for more details.

    for the 2019 release of NLCD which is used with the 2021 release for
    comparisons through the years. Also refer to the larger NLCD Community

          These products were developed as both intermediate steps to generate
          the base NLCD products, and as value added products that standalone
          to provide additional insights. This product was derived using the
          9-epoch NLCD land cover (2001, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016,
          2019, and 2021) from the released NLCD 2021 product suite. Any
          change between two consecutive epochs is calculated and the total
          change frequency/time for each pixel is recorded. This product
          shows an integer count total of any recorded change for the time
          period 2001-2021. This product is meant to be used with the change
          index and individual dates of Land Cover to provide users with a
          more in depth look at where multiple change events in the same
          location are occurring on the landscape. All images include the

          landcover, spectrally stable grass and shrub areas were separated
          from the spectrally changing areas of shrub and grass represented by
          forest harvest, burns, regrowth, and other disturbances.
          Essentially, this separation usually identifies shrub and grass
          climax areas from shrub and grass areas in transition back to a
          forest. This difference is expressed with two extra classes of
          land cover, called Shrub-Forest and Herbaceous-Forest which are
          representing areas of current shrub and grass expected to transition
          back to a forest. Alternatively, the shrub and grass classes of
          Shrub/Scrub and Grassland/Herbaceous will likely not transition to
          a forest. However, be cautioned that no extensive ecological
          analysis went into these class delineations, they are primarily
          spectral based separations used to delineate broad classes of grass
          and shrub. All images include the Science Products classification

          These products were developed as both intermediate steps to generate
          the base NLCD products, and as value added products that standalone
          to provide additional insights. This product shows the most recent
          forest disturbance date between the years 1986-2021 for every year.
          This product combines information from the NLCD 2021 change
          detection, land cover classification, and the LANDFIRE Vegetation
          Change Tracker (VCT) disturbance product from 1984-2010. For NLCD
          2021, this product was used to assess where disturbance occurred for
          forest areas. This product was originally intended only for forest
          areas, but it also can be useful for other landcover classes.
          For example, agricultural areas, which are typically disturbed
          yearly by tillage, are represented as being disturbed prior to 1986.
          This "prior to 86" disturbance call was used in some instances as a
          delineation between forested and non-forest areas. Other classes
          that are not forest may also be represented with a disturbance
          indication if the area was forest at some time point during
          1986-2021. All images include the Science Products classification
